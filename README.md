# Carolina Creative

> Carolina Creative is a way for students to explore all the options UNC Chapel Hill has to offer in regards to creativity. Whether this is a class or club, the app shows a description of it and provides the user with the option to 'Favorite' their selection. The favorites automatically get sent to the favorites box located at the top of the page.

> The user first selects a tab to filter through the categories.
